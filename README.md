# User Cards test

This project implements user cards with an interactive Follow button using React.

Features:

- Clicking Follow button changes its text to "Following", changes color and increases follower count by 1.
- Refreshing the page retains Follow button's text and color and follower count.
- Clicking the Follow button again changes its text and color back to original state and decreases follower count by 1.

There is a local database with the following fields: id, user, tweets, followers, and avatar.
